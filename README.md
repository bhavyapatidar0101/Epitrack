# Covid-19 Data Pipeline and Reporting using Azure

> An end-to-end data engineering project to automate the collection, transformation, and reporting of global COVID-19 data using Azure Data Factory and related Azure services.

## üåü Objective

The goal of this project is to build a scalable, automated data pipeline using Azure Data Factory to ingest, clean, transform, and load COVID-19 data from public sources into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Azure SQL Database. The processed data supports both predictive modeling and real-time analytics through Power BI dashboards.
